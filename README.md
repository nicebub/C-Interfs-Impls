# C Interfaces and Implementations - my modern approach

I will try to implement the code and potentially example program fixes, upgrades, etc

I will try to use the most modern style of C code I can, although it may not be quite the best the first time around

# 	- Chapter 1 -

Program double completed and implemented with changes from exercises at end of chapter.

Programs of code , dotProduct and the 2 distinct strcpy methods were implemented as well
